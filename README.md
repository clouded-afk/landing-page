Landing Page Project:

During the project I showcased my ability to build a front page for a website from the ground up. Using both classes and IDs to make it easier during the styling phase of the project. I would consider this project finished in terms of what was assigned by the Odin Project, but I would like to revisit this later on to make the site more responsive. On a monitor the webpage looks great, but when resizing the browser the page "breaks" and the page does not display as intended. As I continue to improve my skillset, I will return to this project to create a responsive version of the page, so that the webpage displays properly on mobile devices.

Technologies used:
